</p>


<p>flirtbox is a meeting place for singles and we provide that service by operating a dating website &amp; dating app offering users the opportunity to connect to other flirtbox members.
</p>

    <li>email address (not visible to other users)
    </li>

    </li>

</p>

</p>


<p>Once logged in on the website, you also have the opportunity to provide additional details, information and photos of yourself... Because you control your user profile, these details are available to you at any time by accessing your "Profile" page, which gives you the chance to correct or update your information at any time by just logging in to flirtbox. In order to avoid abuse certain information is not directly changeable again and you need to contact us in order to remove it or you need to delete your profile and setup a new one with your correct details (e.g. your gender). Some information might be restricted to being only changeable once without contacting us, such as your date of birth.

</p>

<p>Once you have created a Profile, we will automatically track certain information such as your IP, source of origin (e.g. referred from a different website, Google Play! or from an advertising campaign) and technical details (e.g. your webbrowser or device type). This information is required to optimize the user experience and in order to fix bugs on the website or on mobile devices.
